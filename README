Tk::HistEntry Module

Tk::HistEntry implements an entry widget with history. You may use the up
and down keys to select older entries (or use the associated listbox).

Usage: $top->HistEntry(-textvariable => \$foo,
                       -command => sub {
                         # automatically adds $foo to history
                         print STDERR "Do something with $foo\n";
                       })->pack;

The widget comes in two flavors: the "HistEntry" widget is an
inherited BrowseEntry widget where you see history in the associated
listbox, too. The "SimpleHistEntry" widget is a plain Entry widget.
